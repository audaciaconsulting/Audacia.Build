# Dependency-Track Pipeline Templates

These Azure Pipelines templates automate SBOM generation, upload to OWASP Dependency-Track, and optional deactivation of non-latest project versions.

## What is Dependency-Track?

[OWASP Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/) stores and analyses CycloneDX SBOMs for your applications, identifying vulnerabilities, license issues, and policy violations across your portfolio.
Each upload creates or updates a project and version in Dependency-Track, which the platform monitors continuously.

## Two Ways to Run

| Approach         | When to use                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Modular / Staged | You want Generate, Upload, and Deactivate as separate stages for control and visibility.         |
| End-to-End       | You want a single job that runs the whole flow in one go. Great for small repos or a quick start. |

> **Implementation note:**  
> When using the SBOM generator templates (`generate-dotnet-sbom.steps.yaml` and `generate-npm-sbom.steps.yaml`), the `publishArtifact` setting controls whether each generator publishes its output as a pipeline artifact.
>
> -  **If you are running only one generator** (for example, just the .NET or npm template), set `publishArtifact: true` to publish its SBOMs directly.
> - ️ **If you are running multiple generators** (for example, both .NET and npm), set `publishArtifact: false` on each generator and add a single `PublishPipelineArtifact@1` step afterwards. This publishes a single combined artifact (e.g. `sbom-files`) containing all SBOM outputs.
>
> This approach ensures:
> - A single, consolidated SBOM artifact for multi-ecosystem projects
> - No duplicate or conflicting artifact names
> - Consistent behavior between modular (staged) and end-to-end pipeline designs

## Prerequisites

### 1) Variable group with secrets

To authenticate with your Dependency-Track instance, you must provide an API key to the pipeline. Store this key securely using your preferred secret management mechanism (such as a variable group, environment variable, or secret store) and ensure it is accessible to the pipeline at runtime.

If using Azure DevOps, you can store the key as a secret in a variable group or connect it to Azure Key Vault. For other CI/CD systems, follow the recommended approach for securely managing secrets in your environment.

### 2) Variables configured in the pipeline (optional)

These are defined as pipeline variables within each YAML file or via the “Variables” tab in Azure DevOps.

| Variable                 | Purpose                                                               | Example                              |
|--------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `ENV_NAME`               | Which environment this SBOM represents                                | `dev`, `qa`, `uat`, `prod`           |
| `VERSION`                | Project version value used on upload e.g. `$(Build.SourceBranchName)` | `main`                               |
| `ADDITIONAL_TAGS`        | Optional extra tags recorded on the Dependency-Track project          | `owner:team-x,service:abc`           |
| `DEACTIVATE_OLD`         | Whether to mark all older versions inactive after upload              | `true`                               |
| `PARENT_PROJECT_NAME`    | Optional parent “container” in Dependency-Track                       | `OrganisationName - ApplicationName` |
| `PARENT_PROJECT_VERSION` | Version of the parent (may be left empty)                             | `2025.10` or empty                   |

> ⚠️ Parent projects must match on both name and version exactly (case-sensitive) in Dependency-Track for the link to be established. If the version is left empty or no exact match exists, uploads still succeed but no parent link is created.

## Specifying Projects for SBOM Generation

When specifying a dotnet project, the template expects a `.csproj` file to be specified.
Examples might include:
- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src/YourProject.Api/YourProject.Api.csproj`
- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src/YourProject.Functions/YourProject.Functions.csproj`
- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src/YourProject.Identity/YourProject.Identity.csproj`
- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src/YourProject.Seeding/YourProject.Seeding.csproj`

When specifying an npm project, the template expects **the directory** that contains the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.
Examples might include:
- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src/YourProject.Ui`
- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src/apps`
- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/playwright`
- `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/performance`

The templates will:

- Generate .NET SBOMs via `dotnet CycloneDX` for each listed `.csproj`.
- Generate npm SBOMs via `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm` for each listed SPA root folder (where `package.json` lives).
  If `package-lock.json` isn’t present, the step will create one and run a minimal install for resolution.

> The template automatically installs the necessary tools (`CycloneDX` and `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm`) if not already available.

## Naming Note

Before running the pipeline, verify that the names defined in your `.csproj` and `package.json` files are correct, consistent, and descriptive.
Dependency-Track uses these names directly from the SBOMs to create or update projects.

Avoid:

- Too generic names (`"App"`, `"WebApplication1"`)
- Duplicates across repositories
- Inconsistent naming across components

Recommended naming conventions:

- Backends: `Company.Product.Component`
- Frontends: `company-product-ui`

Ensure names reflect the deployable artifact or service that will appear in reports.

## Project Tags in Dependency-Track

The pipeline templates support adding tags to each project if required, enabling enhanced organization and filtering within Dependency-Track.

In Dependency-Track, tags appear under each project and support filtering, dashboards, and portfolio access control.

The upload step builds tags like:

- `env:<ENV_NAME>` when `ENV_NAME` is set
- Optional comma-separated `ADDITIONAL_TAGS` (e.g. `owner:team-app,service:tickets`)

## Parent Project Linking

If you provide `PARENT_PROJECT_NAME`, the upload attempts to set `parentName` and `parentVersion` for each SBOM.
Dependency-Track performs parent resolution via **exact name and version match (case-sensitive)**.
If no exact match is found, the child projects still upload successfully but remain unlinked.

Use the convention `"<Client> - <System>"` for all parent project names to keep the portfolio consistent.

## Deactivate Non-Latest Versions

After a successful upload, older versions of each project (where `isLatest=false`) are set to inactive.
This keeps the UI focused on the active release while preserving historical versions for audit.

## Azure DevOps Output

- Generate → SBOM file list and counts
- Upload → summary of projects and versions
- Deactivate → Confirmation of inactive versions set

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                      | Likely cause                     | Fix                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `401 Unauthorized` on upload | API key invalid or expired       | Regenerate in Dependency-Track and update the variable group          |
| SBOM not linked to parent    | Name or version mismatch         | Ensure exact parent match exists in Dependency-Track                  |
| “No SBOM files to upload”    | Wrong paths or missing lockfiles | Check `.csproj` and SPA root paths; ensure `package-lock.json` exists |
| Deactivate skipped           | SBOM artifact missing            | Keep `tryDownloadArtifact: true`                                      |
